<h1>My personal skills</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Concept abstraction</h2>
<p>The physical storage size of my brain is finite, so my memory is also finite, just like everyone else. However, I am capable of efficiently abstracting complicated topics into sequences of smaller concepts and focus on the important parts of them instead of attempting to remember everything word by word. </p>
<hr />
<h2>Project digestion with top-down approach</h2>
<p>When working on a programming project, I always love to recursively divide the bigger tasks into multiple smaller tasks. I believe that this approach can help me understand my progress more Intuitively while also incerease the maintainability and readability of my code.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Potential issues and worst case outcome prediction</h2>
<p>While it is great to be optimistic to stay positive, it is also important to consider what would happen in worst case when working for a programming project. I am known to be good at predicting bad outcomes during the planning phase of a project before the issues arise.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Requirements outlining for project planning</h2>
<p>I am capable to outline and predict most of the the required steps and tools before the beginning of every project. This could greatly avoid spending additional time to find things that are needed during the project.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Mild perfectionism in optimization</h2>
<p>I beleive that when it doable and reasonable, my code should be optimized to the best possible performance.</p>
